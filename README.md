# Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Description:

This project focuses on performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listings within a selected city. The goal is to examine various factors such as price, availability, location, and property type to uncover the underlying trends and patterns that influence the demand for Airbnb listings. Through this analysis, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the Airbnb market in the city, helping stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## Objectives:

-   Analyze key factors that influence the demand for Airbnb listings in the city, including but not limited to price, availability, location, and property type.
-   Perform thorough data cleaning to prepare the dataset for in-depth analysis, ensuring the removal of outliers and handling of missing values.
-   Utilize advanced data visualization techniques to illustrate trends and patterns in the data, making it easier to identify key insights.
-   Conduct statistical analysis to substantiate the findings and insights derived from the data.
-   Employ Python and Jupyter Notebook as the primary tools for conducting the analysis and visualization, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
